# Data Bot
Most users work with data on a day-to-day basis. 
Data interaction may range from organizing photos, organizing data in a company, or developing scientific workflows.
While different in complexity above use cases share functionalities like storing data, managing metadata or transforming data. 

There are solutions to tackle individual steps as well as the whole process.
Yet, we believe there is still room for improvement. 
For example, many solutions do not implement open standards, effectively locking users in their ecosystem. 
Other solutions process a small amount of data on a user's computer or a large amount of data on a cluster with nothing in between. 

As users, we should be able to define what data are and where they come from and transform them at will. 
It should be the responsibility of the software to keep track of the metadata and oversee the transformation process on local or remote machines. 
At the same time, the data, metadata, amd transformation scripts must still be under the control of a user.
