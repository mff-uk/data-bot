# Data Factory
Data Factory aims on computing so called data entries.
A data entry can be a remote source or an output computed by a script. 
Scripts can transform one data entry into another. 
Each data entry must be described by metadata that allow for data entry identification. 
As a result, it is possible to reuse data entries during computations. 

A user can specify which data entries should be computed and Data Factory does the heavy lifting.
